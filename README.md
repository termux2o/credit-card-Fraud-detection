# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. The implemented algorithms include Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree classifiers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders. It is highly imbalanced, with only a small fraction of transactions labeled as fraudulent. Due to confidentiality issues, the original features are transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), preserving only numerical input variables.

The dataset can be obtained from the Kaggle website: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
